  scenario_name: Paper-to-Paper Scrapbooking
  description: Attaching decorative paper to a scrapbook page. Very light, indoor use, needs to be repositionable.
  notes: Paper is too weak for mechanical fasteners. Thermal would destroy it. High porosity requires moderate shear strength,
    filtering out very_low/low adhesives. Wood glue (PVA) and Contact cement meet requirements.
