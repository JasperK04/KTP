  scenario_name: One-Sided Access Panel
  description: Attaching access panel to enclosure where only exterior is accessible. Cannot reach inside.
  notes: One-sided access excludes fasteners requiring two-sided access (like hex bolts with nuts). Self-tapping screws or
    blind rivets work.

  scenario_name: Health-Restricted School Project
  description: Elementary school craft project. No fumes, no heat, must be completely safe for children.
  notes: Health constraints exclude thermal and toxic adhesives. PVA glue is non-toxic and standard for school projects. Staples
    are safe if supervised.
