  scenario_name: One-Sided Access Panel
  description: Attaching plastic access panel to metal enclosure where only exterior is accessible. Needs to be openable for
    maintenance.
  notes: One-sided access excludes Hex bolt (needs nut). Plastic+metal uses Sheet metal screw. Rivet is permanent. Removable
    excludes thermal.
