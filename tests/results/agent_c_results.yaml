  scenario_name: Industrial Machine Vibration Mount
  description: Mounting a motor to a metal base plate. Heavy vibration, high dynamic loads, must not loosen.
  notes: Permanent metal-to-metal with vibration. Welding is ideal but Hex bolt with lock washers is also valid for industrial
    mounts. Vibration excludes adhesives.

  scenario_name: Precision Optical Instrument Mount
  description: Mounting optical sensor to metal bracket. Requires precise positioning that won't shift. Permanent installation.
  notes: metal_to_metal allows mechanical+thermal. Dowel pins are ideal for precision positioning - that's their primary purpose.
    Welding also provides permanent, precise joints.
